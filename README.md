# Advent of Code 2021

I am working the Advent of Code 2021 in Java for my own learning.
Each day will be its own package and tests will allow both the examples and actual answers to be available.
To run, make sure you have maven and java (at least java 17) installed and run the following command:
```sh
mvn clean test
```

I will be blogging some days at [my blog](https://ddellspe.net) so feel free to subscribe/follow for your own fun. In addition, I will be trying some solutions out using the product that my company, SnapLogic, provides, when those happen, I will attach solutions or blog posts that happen here
